# Question Bank Filter Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

When filtering questions by source (Practice Hub vs Mastery Assessment) in the Question Bank, the results were not updating instantly. Users had to navigate to another tab and come back to see the filtered results.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was with **React Query caching and query key management**:

### **Missing Query Dependencies**
The React Query hooks were not including all filter values in their query keys:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
queryKey: ['question-bank', selectedType, selectedDifficulty, searchTerm]
//         ↑ Missing selectedSource, selectedDomain, selectedModule

// When selectedSource changed, React Query didn't know to refetch
// because the query key remained the same
```

### **How React Query Works**
- React Query caches data based on query keys
- When query key changes → refetch data
- When query key stays same → use cached data
- **Problem**: Changing `selectedSource` didn't change the query key

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **Updated Query Keys**
Added all filter dependencies to query keys:

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed)
queryKey: [
  'question-bank', 
  selectedSource,     // ✅ Added
  selectedDomain,     // ✅ Added  
  selectedModule,     // ✅ Added
  selectedType, 
  selectedDifficulty, 
  searchTerm
]
```

### **Both Queries Fixed**
Updated both practice and mastery question queries:

#### Practice Questions Query
```typescript
const { data: practiceQuestions = [], isLoading: loadingPractice } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['question-bank', selectedSource, selectedDomain, selectedModule, selectedType, selectedDifficulty, searchTerm],
  queryFn: async () => {
    if (selectedSource === 'mastery') return [];
    // ... fetch logic
  },
});
```

#### Mastery Questions Query
```typescript
const { data: masteryQuestions = [], isLoading: loadingMastery } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['question-bank-mastery', selectedSource, selectedDomain, selectedModule, selectedType, selectedDifficulty, searchTerm],
  queryFn: async () => {
    if (selectedSource === 'practice') return [];
    // ... fetch logic
  },
});
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Instant Filter Updates**
1. **User changes source filter** (Practice Hub ↔ Mastery Assessment)
2. **Query key changes** (includes new selectedSource value)
3. **React Query detects change** and refetches data immediately
4. **UI updates instantly** with filtered results

### **Complete Cache Management**
All filter changes now trigger proper cache invalidation:
- ✅ **Source Filter** (Practice Hub / Mastery Assessment)
- ✅ **Domain Filter** (Python, DevOps, etc.)
- ✅ **Module Filter** (specific modules within domains)
- ✅ **Type Filter** (MCQ, Coding, Scenario)
- ✅ **Difficulty Filter** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- ✅ **Search Term** (text search)

## 🧪 Testing Results

### **Before Fix**
- ❌ Change source filter → No immediate update
- ❌ Had to navigate away and back to see results
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **After Fix**
- ✅ Change source filter → Instant update
- ✅ All filters work immediately
- ✅ Smooth, responsive user experience

## 📋 Technical Details

### **Files Modified**
- **`QuestionBank.tsx`**: Updated query keys for both practice and mastery queries

### **Query Key Strategy**
```typescript
// Complete dependency list ensures proper cache invalidation
[
  'query-name',        // Base identifier
  selectedSource,      // Practice vs Mastery
  selectedDomain,      // Domain filter
  selectedModule,      // Module filter  
  selectedType,        // Question type filter
  selectedDifficulty,  // Difficulty filter
  searchTerm          // Search text
]
```

### **Performance Impact**
- ✅ **Positive**: Instant filter responses
- ✅ **Minimal**: Query keys are lightweight strings
- ✅ **Efficient**: React Query handles caching optimally

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### **Immediate Feedback**
- Filters respond instantly to user input
- No need to navigate away and back
- Smooth, professional interface

### **Consistent Behavior**
- All filters now work the same way
- Predictable user experience
- Matches expected behavior patterns

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### **Query Optimization**
- Current approach fetches all data then filters on frontend
- Future enhancement: Apply filters at database level for better performance
- Consider server-side pagination for large datasets

### **Cache Strategy**
- Current approach creates separate cache entries for each filter combination
- Consider implementing smarter cache invalidation strategies
- Monitor cache size with many filter combinations

## 📊 Summary

**Root Cause**: Missing filter dependencies in React Query keys
**Solution**: Added all filter values to query keys
**Result**: Instant filter updates and improved user experience

The Question Bank now provides immediate, responsive filtering across all filter options! 🎉
