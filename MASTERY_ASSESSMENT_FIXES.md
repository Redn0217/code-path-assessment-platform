# Mastery Assessment Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Delete Question Error**
**Problem**: Delete function was receiving `[object Object]` instead of question ID, causing 400 Bad Request error.

**Root Cause**: 
- QuestionTable passes the whole `question` object to `onDelete`
- useMasteryQuestions hook expected only the ID string
- URL became: `...?id=eq.%5Bobject+Object%5D` (encoded `[object Object]`)

**Solution**: Updated `handleDelete` function to handle both question objects and ID strings:

```typescript
// Before (only handled string IDs)
const handleDelete = (id: string) => {
  if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this question?')) {
    deleteQuestion.mutate(id);
  }
};

// After (handles both objects and strings)
const handleDelete = (questionOrId: any) => {
  // Handle both question object and ID string
  const id = typeof questionOrId === 'string' ? questionOrId : questionOrId.id;
  
  if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this question?')) {
    deleteQuestion.mutate(id);
  }
};
```

### 2. **Button Layout Issue**
**Problem**: "Add from Question Bank" and "Add New Question" buttons were displayed on a new line below the header instead of being aligned with the title.

**Root Cause**: 
- Buttons were rendered in a separate `<div className="px-6 pb-2">` container
- Not integrated with the header layout

**Solution**: Moved buttons to the header component using a flexible layout:

#### Updated MasteryAssessmentHeader
```typescript
interface MasteryAssessmentHeaderProps {
  assessment: any;
  parsedDomains: string[];
  onBack: () => void;
  actionButtons?: React.ReactNode; // New prop for buttons
}

// Layout with buttons on the right
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
    {/* Back button and title */}
  </div>
  {actionButtons && (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      {actionButtons}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

#### Updated MasteryAssessmentQuestionManager
```typescript
<MasteryAssessmentHeader
  assessment={assessment}
  parsedDomains={parsedDomains}
  onBack={onBack}
  actionButtons={
    <QuestionActions
      // ... all props
    />
  }
/>
```
