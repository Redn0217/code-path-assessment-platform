WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT question_bank_id FROM questions 
  WHERE module_id = $moduleId
)

-- Assign selected questions
INSERT INTO questions (module_id, question_bank_id)
VALUES ($moduleId, $questionBankId)
```

### For System Architecture
- **Data Reuse**: Maximizes value of question bank investment
- **Consistency**: Maintains question quality across modules
- **Scalability**: Easy to manage large question libraries
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for question content

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
1. **Basic Assignment**: Select and assign single question
2. **Bulk Assignment**: Select and assign multiple questions
3. **Search Functionality**: Search by title and content
